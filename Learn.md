Learn AirGlyph – Gesture-Based Communication Project

Welcome to AirGlyph – a beginner-friendly project that uses gestures for simple communication.
This guide will help you understand, build, and customize your own AirGlyph system.

What is AirGlyph?

AirGlyph is a gesture-based communication system that uses an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope to detect tilts and display short messages on a 16x2 I2C LCD.

Built as a 1st-year B.Tech (CSE) project

Enables silent communication (like “hello” or “bye”)

Great for Arduino beginners

Features

Detects tilt gestures using MPU6050

Displays mapped phrases on I2C LCD

Optional extra gestures using gyroscope (commented in code)

Beginner-friendly and fully open-source

Highly customizable – add your own gestures & messages

Components Required

Arduino Uno / Nano

MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)

I2C 16x2 LCD (usually address 0x27)

Jumper wires + breadboard

Both MPU6050 and LCD share the I2C bus.

How It Works

MPU6050 sends motion data (ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz).

Arduino maps tilt direction to a predefined phrase.

The phrase is displayed on the LCD screen.

Example Mapping:

Forward Tilt → "hello"

Left Tilt → "how are you?"

Backward Tilt → "bye"

Right Tilt → "have a great day!"

Example Code Snippet
if (ax > 12000) {
  message = "hello";        // Forward
} else if (ax < -12000) {
  message = "bye";          // Backward
} else if (ay < -12000) {
  message = "how are you?"; // Left
} else if (ay > 12000) {
  message = "have a great day!"; // Right
}

// Optional gestures (commented):
// if (az > 16000) message = "yes";
// if (gx > 15000) message = "stop";

Customization Ideas

Add more gestures (e.g., wrist flicks, up/down face).

Display icons or animations on the LCD.

Connect with a Bluetooth module to send messages to a phone.

Integrate with IoT platforms for remote communication.
